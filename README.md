#1 I have a table (users) with two fields: id and name. Write a SQL query (not Ruby code) that returns the first 5 names that contain 'r'. The order should be:
    First, words that start with 'r' in alphabetical order.
    Second, words that contain 'r' in alphabetical order.
    So - if my list of names is: Alex, Arik, Rebecca, Rose, Brad, Viki, Norman, Drake, Carrie, Taylor, Frank, Robert, Spencer, Chris.
    The order of the results should be: Rebecca, Robert, Rose, Arik, Brad.
